"""Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM) â€” placeholder.

Training utilities to add a physics residual term to the FM objective with *conflict-free* updates:
- Compute g_FM and g_R (residual) and align them using ConFIG-style projection.
- Support temporal unrolling to obtain accurate x_1 for residual evaluation.
- Optionally try a stochastic sampler at inference.
